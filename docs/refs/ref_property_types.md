# Property Types

FuncGodot supports many of the [Godot Variant types](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_%40globalscope.html#enum-globalscope-variant-type). Consult the [key values section of the FGD page on the Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/FGD#key values) for more information on FGD value types.

| [NodePath](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_nodepath.html)       | target_destination | NodePath is intended as a targeting property type in map editors, similar to Quake's "target" property. Some map editors may have additional editor display options showing links between entities. Not utilized in every map editor. Returns a _String_ on map build.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Material](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_material.html)       | material / shader  | Material is intended as a texture path property type in map editors. Some map editors may offer a texture picker. J.A.C.K. utilizes the _shader_ key word (make sure to set your [FuncGodotFGDFile's target_map_editor property](ref_fgd_resources.html#File) to _JACK_). Returns a _String_ on map build, using the assigned default Material's resource path as the property's value.                                                                               |
| [Texture2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texture2d.html)     | decal              | Texture2D is intended as a decal texture path property type in map editors. Some map editors may offer a texture picker, typically filtered to only access a _decals.wad_. In the map editor, the texture at the specified path will behave in a similar way to [Godot's Decal node](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_decal.html). Returns a _String_ on map build, using the assigned default Texture2D's resource path as the property's value. |
| [AudioStream](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audiostream.html) | sound              | AudioStream is intended as an audio file path property type in map editors. Some map editors may offer a sound picker. Returns a _String_ on map build, using the assigned default AudioStream's resource path as the property's value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Object](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_object.html)           | target_source      | Object is intended as a target name property type in map editors, similar to Quake's "targetname" property. Some map editors may have additional editor display options showing links between entities. Not utilized in every map editor. Returns a _String_ on map build.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
