# Applying Key Values

It's pretty easy to apply entity key value pairs to nodes generated by FuncGodot. You have one property and two methods that you can use: the Dictionary `func_godot_properties`, the method `_func_godot_apply_properties(entity_properties: Dictionary)`, and the deferred method `_func_godot_build_complete()`.

After the entity is built, FuncGodot will check if the entity contains a `func_godot_properties` Dictionary, and if it exists it will apply the translated key value pairs as a Dictionary to this variable. In order for the application to persist at Runtime or after closing your scene, you'll need to make sure the variable is an `@export` variable.

Use `_func_godot_apply_properties` to apply your key value pairs to your node, as they are passed through the `_func_godot_properties` argument in the function.

`_func_godot_build_complete` is a deferred call that happens after every entity has called `_func_godot_apply_properties`, making it safe to reference any nodes generated during `_func_godot_apply_properties`.

You are allowed to limit yourself to only the application methods you're interested in. Mix and match these options as you see fit for your entities.
