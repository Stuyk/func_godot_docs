# What Are Key Value Pairs?
-------------------------

Key Value Pairs are the most powerful aspect of FuncGodot. All of the _Class Properties_ set in a [FuncGodotFGDEntity](ref_fgd_resources.html#Entity) definition get added to the corresponding entity placed in the map editor.

Key Value Pairs are defined in a _FuncGodotFGDEntityClass_ resource's _Class Properties_ dictionary. A Class Property is defined with a key String and a value of many of the [Godot Variant Types](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_variant.html) (see [Property Types](#PropertyTypes) below for a full list). The value set becomes both the default value and the Variant type the FuncGodotMap applies to that property on map build.

Additionally, you can define a property description. With the exception of [Choices](#Choices) and [Bit Flags](#BitFlags), property descriptions are created by matching a key from _Class Properties_ to the _Class Property Descriptions_ dictionary and setting a **String** value for the description.

The result as it appears in TrenchBroom:

If you plan on using J.A.C.K. you may want to use the descriptions as proper names for the keys rather than actual descriptions. The same entity's properties as they appear in J.A.C.K.:

Once the corresponding node is generated by a [FuncGodotMap](ref_func_godot_map.html), these key value pairs are then applied to the generated node's _func_godot_properties_ dictionary. Additionally, if you add undefined key value pairs in your map editor, these too will be added to your node's _func_godot_properties_ dictionary.

> _NOTE: Entity keys that are not given values will have their default values applied to the generated node's_ func_godot_properties _dictionary._
